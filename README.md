My projects related to my Data Structure Class in San Diego State University. 

#PA1: Sortable array
/** Sortable Array (C++): This project implements a sortable array class with the insertion sort algorithm. 
* The program reads an unsorted list of numbers from a file, sorts the contents using insertion sort, and then writes the sorted numbers to an output file.
* Additional functionalities include adding and removing elements, managing array size, and file handling for input and output operations.
* /

#PA2: Priority Queue
/*Priority Queue (C++): This project implements three versions of a priority queue using different data structures: an ordered array, a linked list, and a binary heap. 
* Each implementation ensures that elements are dequeued based on priority, with FIFO order preserved for elements of equal priority.
* The binary heap implementation uses O(log n) insertion and removal for efficiency, while the ordered array uses binary search for certain operations.
* The project is designed to meet the specifications of a priority queue abstract data type (ADT) with stable sorting and supports typical queue operations such as insertion, deletion, and peeking.
*

#PA3: Red-Black Tree
/*
* Red-Black Tree (C++): In this assignment, a Red-Black Tree data structure is implemented, supporting basic operations like adding, removing, searching, and balancing the tree to maintain its red-black properties.
* The project also handles tree rotations and fixes potential violations, ensuring that the tree maintains efficient O(log n) performance for insertions and deletions.
